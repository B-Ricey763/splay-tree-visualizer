# Features

Visualize splay trees!

The interactive component was built using Typescript and React, with Shadcn/ui for the beautiful components, Tanstack Router for routing (of which there is only a home page), and framer-motion for the smooth animations.

The site is hosted via Github pages for free, easy access on the web. The splay tree code uses an alternate implementation than the original paper, using a left and right node pointer instead of a child-sibling pointer approach. During every operation, the current tree state is pushed to an animation stack that saves that "frame" of the tree's state, so it can be animated once the operation completes.

# Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start  
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Shadcn

Add components using the latest version of [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).
